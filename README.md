>In order to use this version of the Pathfinder you will need to take the files from the Moonsharp folder and CustomProshine and replace those in your proshine folder by them. This moonsharp modification is a simple fix that has been merged already, and you can check the proshine changes if you like on my github, everything is public.

##Pathfinder for Proshine
This script provides a module to move from a map A to a map B using the shortest path.  
The Objective of this project is to provide a tool to simplify scripting in proshine. So you don't have to use an elseif per map you're crossing.  
It also provides advanced functionality, settings, and more...  

[For explanation on how to use read HOWTO](https://github.com/MeltWS/ProShinePathfinder/blob/dev/Pathfinder/HOWTO.md).  
Use `LoadMe_Test.lua` to test the module, I recommand you read it as well.  
You should also read and modify the setting file located in `Pathfinder/Settings/static_Settings.lua` to your needs.  

#####Features

* Move to the requested map or go to the closest in a list of Map given. Supports most of the maps of the 3 main regions.
* Move to the closest Pokecenter.
* Use the closest Pokecenter.
* Use the closest Pokemart to buy the requiered items. (testing, item map need to be completed.)
* Uses Bike or Mount.
* Uses digways as shortcut if has a Pokemon that can use dig.
* Discover digways if it can't use it.
* Subway support for the 3 main regions.
* Train and bot support from one Region to another.
* Headbutt trees, on the way.
* Dig digspots on the way.
* Discover all items on the way.
* Harvest berries on the way. ( currently need more testing )
* Settings for every features above.
* Custom Settings per Bot.
* Provides Examples such as a script to get the 3 rods in the game, or a script to level anywhere.

#####Know issues :

* The pathfinder does not consider having Bot or Surf and will find Path as if you could use them.
* No error in exception handling.
* Moving to the nearest Pokecenter can find a more distant Pokecenter if the current Map exist multiple times ( This is an issue with the current exception handling).
* X map does not work! Not everything is currently implemented, I welcome help if you want to implement maps, make pull request on github.
* Planning on dig and headbutt scripts. ( all you have to do it tell it where to go.)
* Planning on adding excavations support ( I don't have any account with access at the moment. )

A simple implementation of the A* pathfinding algorithm  
The `aStar` function expect a few more arguments than most other implementations available anywhere.  
I therefore invite you to read `example.lua`
